= Herd

Because naming is hard.

AWS CLI for getting to the most needed info I use everyday 
but dont want to open the AWS Console to look up. 

Modeled after projects such as acli and jungle.  Both python
projects.  Since they both are incomplete to what I wanted
and I was looking for a project to learn Go.  I wrote herd
as a way to do both.  

=== Current Status

Currently ec2 searching works.  I will start adding more 
and more services as time goes on.  I will try to stay
on top of keeping the code base clean.  Pull requests 
welcome.
